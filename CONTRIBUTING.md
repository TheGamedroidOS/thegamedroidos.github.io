## üìú Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please report unacceptable behavior to [TeamGameDroidOS](mailto:teamgamedroidos@gmail.com).

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/thegamedroidos.github.io
   cd gamedroid
   ```
3. **Set up upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original_owner/thegamedroidos.github.io
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

## üíª Development Environment

GameDroid is built with vanilla technologies, so the setup is straightforward:

- **Text Editor/IDE**: VS Code, Sublime Text, or your preferred editor
- **Server**: Any simple HTTP server will work:
  - VS Code Live Server extension
  - Python's `http.server`: `python -m http.server`
  - Node's `http-server`: `npx http-server`
- **Browser Dev Tools**: For testing and debugging

## ü§ù How Can I Contribute?

### Adding New Games

We're always looking for new games! Here's how to add yours:

1. Create a new directory in `/games/your-game-name/`
2. Your game should be contained in this directory with an `index.html` entry point
3. Update the game registry in `script.js`:

```javascript
// Add to drawerOnlyApps array (Avoid adding games on home screen. Currently we don't accept keyboard based games, so optimise your games for mobile)
const drawerOnlyApps = [
  // Existing apps...
  { id: 'yourgame', name: 'Your Game Name', icon: 'fas fa-icon-name' }
];

// Add path to appPaths object
const appPaths = {
  // Existing paths...
  yourgame: '/games/your-game-name/index.html'
};
```
Note: I will made an app centre to display your games to new visitors. Then I may remove less usable games from the app drawer.

- If you have a game or any idea and want us to get a quick look at it, feel free to connect with us at [Mail](mailto:teamgamedroidos@gmail.com).

- Even if you don't have any idea you can fix any typo.

- [Report](mailto:teamgamedroidos@gmail.com) any bug or error

#### Game Development Guidelines

- Keep games lightweight (<500KB recommended)
- Ensure mobile responsiveness (touch controls, flexible layouts)
- Support both portrait and landscape orientations when possible
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery or other libraries unless absolutely necessary)
- Provide clear instructions for players
- Implement a pause mechanism for when game loses focus

### Improving Existing Games
